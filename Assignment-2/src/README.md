# Assignment 2

## Instructions: How to run the code
I have written my code in C++. Below are instructions on how to run my code from the Command-line(Windows).

problem1.cpp:

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1**
2) To run the executable simply type the name of the executable: **problem1**

problem2.cpp

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ problem2.cpp -o problem2**
2) To run the executable simply type the name of the executable: **problem2**

Example Usage:

C:\Users> **g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1**

C:\Users> **problem1**
