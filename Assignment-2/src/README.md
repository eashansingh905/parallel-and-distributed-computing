## Instructions: How to run the code
I have written my code in C++. Below are instructions on how to run my code from the Command-line(Windows).

To run problem 1:

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ problem1.cpp -o problem1**

To run problem 2: 

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ problem2.cpp -o problem2**
2) To run the executable simply type the name of the executable: **problem2**

Usage:

C:\Users> g++ problem2.cpp -o problem2
C:\Users> problem2
