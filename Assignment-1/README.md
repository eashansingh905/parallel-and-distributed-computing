#### Assignment 1: Primes

### Instruction: How to run the code

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ primes.cpp -o primes**
2) To run the executable simply type the name of the executable: **primes**

Usage:

C:\Users> g++ primes.cpp -o primes   
C:\Users> primes

The **primes.txt** file will be generated in the current working directory(directory with the **primes.cpp** file).

The **primes.txt** file is formated as such:

<Execution time in milliseconds> <Number of primes found> <Sum of all primes>
<List of top 10 largest primes>
