# Assignment 3

## Instructions: How to run the code
I have written my code in C++. Below are instructions on how to run my code from the Command-line(Windows).
Code for problem 1 is in **presents.cpp**. Code for problem 2 is in **temperature.cpp**.

presents.cpp:

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ presents.cpp -o presents**
2) To run the executable simply type the name of the executable: **presents**

temperature.cpp

1) Go to the command-line and generate the executable: **g++ temperature.cpp -o temperature**
2) To run the executable simply type the name of the executable: **temperature**

Example Usage:

C:\Users> **g++ presents.cpp -o presents**

C:\Users> **presents**
